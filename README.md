# E-Store
# In this project we build an e-commerce website nothing innovative just to practice.
# The main feautres are:
  # -A private interface for the owner to: add, delete and modify a product.
  # -Create an account as a client.
  # -Sign in and sign out.
  # -Select the categorie of products you want to see (smartphones, tv, ...).
  # -Search for a product (by name) in a certain categorie.
  # -Sort products by: name or price.
  # -See products of a given brand in a categorie.
  # -Add a product to the shopping cart.
  # -Checkout by giving the shipping adress and credit card number.
  # These are the basics feautres this e-store should provides for now, and of course we can expand it to become more reliable and secure and also to give the user a great experience while shopping online.
